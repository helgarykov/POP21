To write and interpret the program, we used the interpreter mode. To
run the code and execute it in the console, we ran the fsharpc
that compiles the program and the mono that executes the program and
delivers the result on the screen.

In the assignment at hand, we used an alternative method (System.Console.WriteLine) that allows to filter output from a program
directly from the command-line in the console without having to use the printfn-function in the interpreter mode.
